### Disclaimer
Please only provide info for tools/packages that are official or version control that are the official repo. If it isn't not the official repo, then I will take significantly longer, because I want to read through your code and make sure the alterations you did to it aren't malicious. I don't want the people who use this project to install malicious code (that isn't used for pentesting, but to affect the actual user of the OS), so I won't merge it in the offical branch till I feel comfortable with what I am adding.

**Name**
What is the name of the tool?

**Vendor (Optional)**
Who creates the tool?

**link**
Please do one of the following if it is a:
1) package in Kali's repos please provide the name of the package during an `apt-get install`
2) github (or any other version control (i.e. bitbucket, etc...)) repo, then please provide a link

**Additional context**
Please detail why would you like to see the tool in a base installation of Kali Linux, compared to installing when you do a vagrant up or installing from Kali's repos?
